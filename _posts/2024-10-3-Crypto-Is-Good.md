title: Crypto Is Good
---

Has there ever been a technology which people felt more emotionally attached to or revolted by? Why do people like crypto so much? Why does it piss them off so much?

I think that "crypto" is a big tent for a lot of ideas, kind of like a political party, and so we up having to choose our issue and see which side of the debate we fall given that single issue. I think that some people who hate crypto might be heavily aligned with certain aspects of it, but hate others so vehemently that they cannot see beyond it. On the other side, it feels like a lot of crypto is a money cult.

It's a lot more nuanced than that, and like politics, I think that most normal people get shoved into a debate between extremes that doesn't really make sense, but nonetheless is driven forward by the loudest and craziest people (as well as lots of scammers and grifters). *Most* people just keep quiet.

I am not a quiet person, and I've suffered for it. Disinvited, banned from servers, doxxed, blocked, banned, you name it. I don't trade crypto, I don't really own significant amounts of crypto, I don't care if number goes up at all. But I commmitted the sin of thinking that programming with decentralized technology was interesting-- and I-- *gasp* npm installed the unholy ethers.js, thirdweb, metamask, the whole shebang of dark arts.

Let's get this straight, crypto is a big tent. Let's break it apart.

# Most "Crypto" You See *Really Is* Scam

99% of crypto-related stuff you see is an actual scam. As in, there are scammers trying to steal your money, often closely mimicking the branding of a real project to trick followers into sending all their tokens. The randoms talking about ELON BOUGHT THIS TOKEN-- that's actually a scam, and if you click on the website you'll lose everything. There's no coin.

There is nothing new about this, but since crypto transactions cannot be reversed and there is no PayPal Fraud Detection Unit to deal wit it, it's just way easier to scam people with crypto and get away with it.

# The Rest Is A Shill

Anyone can make a token, get people to buy in and make a fat bag. Deploying a token contract used to cost hundreds of dollars on Ethereum (and still does), but most of the current crypto meta you see has moved to chains where anyone can spin up their own token for a few bucks.

This has created massive incentive to produce large quantities of bots to shill tokens as a service. The people who start the token hire the shill teams, who run the bots. Some shillers are kids or low-wage workers just doing it by hand or with scripts, a lot are just ChatGPT bots now.

For anyone who isn't a bot, they are all incentivized to sell you something. There are lots of people in crypto not trying to sell you something, but they're not in the public square yelling and selling. Everyone who buys crypto is immediately incentivized to pump that token and get others to buy it.

However, even on Crypto Twitter, just shilling a crappy memecoin bag is kinda cheeseball and mostly it's bots following bots. Successful projects tend to contribute culturally with memes, GIFs, weird art and cultural artifacts that increase the popularity of the meme behind their token or project. Because these are often for their own culture, they are not even recognized as crypto-- for example, at this point the vast majority of Twitter knows what Milady is but has no idea that it's a crypto project.

This actually works to harm crypto, PR-wise, even worse. Anything that looks like scummy crypto is crypto, and most things that are legitimate, well, people have no idea they're crypto.

# But The Technology Is Real

The problem is that it's really hard to talk about the technology in good faith without people bringing steadfast opinions based on their cultural biases and perceptions.

The people who are building the actual technology are usually not the ones shilling memecoins, scamming people, hyping doge bullshit or any of that. They are largely not motivated by money in and of itself, although they may believe that money is an important building block of society. Most devs I've talked to who believe in crypto came for the dream of a decentralized world built on a decentralized internet.

The main argument that people lob against crypto is that it's not useful. I just cannot disagree more. Crypto has also enabled a decentralized creative economy to flourish. Cracked teenagers are making a living in far off places building and coding, receiving payment in crypto and divying with their crew in kind. Earning $40/hr is totally viable for a hardworking kid self-teaching from YouTube videos. In a world where many digital creatives beg for donations via Patreon or take small commissions to get by, crypto is a low-friction and viable path to get paid and earn a living.

It would be really awesome if a community could fund a project they believe in, like a game, and then receive some kind of profit from the success of the game. Currently, this is illegal. Most "legitimate" crypto is about creatively getting around this without pissing off the SEC. Right now, decentralized ownership is basically impossible with the current system of corporations, as someone has to assume liability, and this person usually then also has the keys to the kingdom. It ensures that communities really can't invest in projects expecting any return-- only singular entities with large sums of capital can. While this prevents scammers, it also prevents the next Minecraft from emerging on Discord.

# The Future Is Decentralized

In the present, decentralization is an abstract concept. But more and more of our lives are being centralized to just a small handful of datacenters run by a small handful of companies.

I don't think everything needs to be decentralized. But having a parity option for open source and decentralized with closed source and centralized is important. It's important to have the choice. It keeps everyone honest.

Most crypto will not be spent directly by people. I think that for most of us, money is becoming an abstract concept, and if we could have an AI agent tell us that we have enough and we're on track to get the things we want, that'd probably be fine. I don't know about you, but I'm overwhelmed with information. I just wanna know I have enough. I think this overwhelm is a trend, and using agents to reduce overwhelm by taking things off our plate is the primary value of agents and intelligent systems.

In this world, programmatic money is just so incredibly useful. For one, agents can use it today-- no PayPal account necessary. Tokens don't have to be worth financial value, but could represent reputation, access, membership, etc. In a world where we are all increasingly becoming strangers, decentralized reputation systems may be a useful way for society to regulate itself without needing security state-level centralized sociaal credit systems and surveillance.

I'd like to see a world where people are more fair and cooperative, and so need less social control to behave correctly. In order to achieve this without becoming China, we need to give anyone the ability to issue tokens of all kinds, and value them as they see fit, socially or economically or whatever it is. I don't love that it has to all start with money, and it has to go through these gross hype cycles, but I just don't see another way.

When crypto is really ready for prime time, there will be no hype, no luxury goods, no pump and dump. It'll just be the roads and the streets of the Internet, as boring as TCP and TLS.

If you want to hate me for npm installing some packags and engaging in the sci-fi future for fun and profit, well, I guess that is your prerogative, but it's a pretty objectively stupid position to hold. I think we can agree the current meta enabled by crypto tech sucks-- but that's just a temporary blip in the long run of things. Shitting on technology that is a decade old has almost always been a bad investment of time and intellectual capital. It's possible to have a nuanced view, and to think that scams and grifters are dumb but that solving Byzantine's Generals problem is interesting and has social value.
