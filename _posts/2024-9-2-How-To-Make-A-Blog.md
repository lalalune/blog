title: How To Make a Blog
---

I wanted a blog. Nothing fancy at all. In fact, I wanted the most simple, self-hosted, bare bones thing I could find, just to write some markdown in.

Github Pages already has a Jekyll static site generator built in, but setting up Jekyll is a pain (it takes up to several minutes, no thanks). So I found this really simple solution called Jekyll Now: https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now

Forked it, edited the config yaml, and that was it. Well, I wanted to modify it a bit. So I removed underlines from links in the style.scss, deleted the "about" section and updated the Hello World post.

And that's it! I went to the "Github Pages" tab in my forked repo's settings, but I didn't have to change anything.

Easiest setup ever, and now I have a blog. Took me about as much time as it took you to read this.
