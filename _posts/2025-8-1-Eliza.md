A long time ago I had a dream-- to create an open source AI agent that many people built together. Somthing that started off as just a bunch of code and became a friend, a champion, the organizer and the organization. Eliza DAO was the idea.

For the last year, that's what I've been working on. So much has happened. I wish I had written about it-- I have many drafts. But I found it really hard. I caught myself feeling wounded, feeling overwhelmed, a lot of things I just didn't want to put out there.

A lot of hard lessons learned in a short time.

Things feel stable now. The tech is realized. We're now expanding on what Eliza is. Who Eliza is.

What a time to be alive.

Here's the code:
