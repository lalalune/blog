title: The Debt Is Paid
---

A few years ago I made a bet with John Carmack for $10,000. I lost the bet, which unfortunately timed with some pretty hard life experiences, so it took a little while to pay it all off but it's finally been settled.

I didn't have to make good on the bet. Until recently I was just an anonymous internet person. But everything I have has come from the Internet, and my friends are also anonymous internet people. The hive mind is incredibly important to me. If anonymity is just an excuse to not be accountable for your actions, then that just seems like a shitty world to live in.

Out of context, it probably sounds like a really stupid bet. I didn't ever think I'd win-- that wasn't the point. I wasn't betting on the market-- I was betting on myself and what I was working on. I had a project that I really believed would help me win, and the bet was like a rallying cry for our team. "Losing is still winning." If the startup had succeed and not turned into a continuing legal quagmire, we would have leveraged the bet up to the end for a good bit of PR, and I think I could have well justified the business expense as a good investment.

And on some level I just wanted to engage with Carmack. I look up to him as a paragon of what a great engineer should be-- driven, curious, hard working and honest, even when it might cause conflict. People spend money on dumb shit all the time. For me, it was fun.

My advice to anyone betting against Carmack: don't, unless losing also has clear benefits to you.
